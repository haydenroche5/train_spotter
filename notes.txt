- Get train detector up and running on the RPi.
- Set up a workflow that does the following:
1) Checks data/ for new images by hashing and comparing the hash to the previous hash. If they don't match, split 90% of data into training, 10% into validation, re-train, and commit the results with a version number to git (tag).
2) Push this.
3) RPi should pull the repo daily to get the latest.
